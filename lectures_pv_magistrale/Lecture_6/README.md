For this lecture lecture two notebooks are offered to show the usage of an autoencoder for unsupervised classification.
The basic algorithm is taken from the noteboooks by Maurizio Pierini (https://github.com/pierinim/tutorials/tree/master/GGI_Jan2021)
For the first notebook the AE is applied to the same  analysis task as for the previous lecture, for the second to a jet ID task. 
The second one is taken without modifications from the link above
